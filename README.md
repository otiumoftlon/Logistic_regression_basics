# Logistic_regression_basics
This project involves a scratch implementation of logistic regression, accompanied by data analysis and a comparison with existing methods in scikit-learn. The primary application of this method is in modeling the classification of cancer tumors, specifically to determine whether they are benign or malignant. Additionally, the analysis explores strategies for creating a lighter model using correlation analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

It is possible to see the full analysis in a notion report in the following link: https://discreet-book-31a.notion.site/Logistic-Regression-119bef23a79280328d71f84262bef085?pvs=4
